                    I’m a third-year student at Western University pursing an Honours Specialization in
                    Computer Science, with a passion for exploring the latest trends and topics in all things machine
                    learning, full-stack web development, and software engineering. I love the creative
                    freedom and flexibility that comes with building websites and web applications, and I'm constantly
                    exploring new frameworks and libraries to enhance my skills. The field of machine learning
                    fascinates me with its unique blend of creativity, logic, and technology, inspiring me to explore
                    its various applications, including supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms, to
                    tackle real-world problems. When I’m not at my computer I like to spend my time reading, running,
                    and playing board games.
